    <h1>Javascript vs Ruby</h1>
  <h4>February 04th, 2015</h4>

    <p>
        It’s week 7 here in DBC Phase-0 and we’re finally learning Javascript! The introduction has been pretty quick because many of the same fundamental Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts we learned in Ruby are transferable. I’d like to cover this by reviewing the difference between Ruby Classes and Javascript Constructor functions.
    </p>    

    <p>
        <b>Ruby Classes</b><br />

        The idea behind a class is that you can model an object with certain properties and make many types of that object with the same properties. Hence, object oriented programming. This helps reduce repeated code and ideally is less difficult to maintain (this is a whole other story). In Ruby you may want to make an Animal object that has the properties; type of animal, name, and sounds they make. Then from that blueprint you can make a cat that meows named “princess monster-truck”, a dog that woofs named “marnie”, and a dolphin that Eeeeee’s named “Flipper”. In Ruby, your code might look something like this.<br /><br />

        class Animal<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;attr_reader :name, :type, :sound<br /><br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;def initialize(name, type, sound)<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    @name = name<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    @type = type<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    @sound = sound<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br />
        end<br /><br />

        my_cat = Animal.new("Princess Monster-Truck","Cat","Meeeeeow!")<br />
        my_dog = Animal.new("Marnie","Dog","Wooooof!")<br />
        my_dolphin = Animal.new("Flipper","Dolphin","Eeeeeee!")<br /><br />

        puts "My #{my_cat.type}'s name is #{my_cat.name} and she goes #{my_cat.sound}"<br />
        puts "My #{my_dog.type}'s name is #{my_dog.name} and she goes #{my_dog.sound}"<br />
        puts "My #{my_dolphin.type}'s name is #{my_dolphin.name} and she goes #{my_dolphin.sound}"<br /><br />


        This is what my program prints out:<br /><br />
        My Cat's name is Princess Monster-Truck and she goes Meeeeeow!<br />
        My Dog's name is Marnie and she goes Wooooof!<br />
        My Dolphin's name is Flipper and she goes Eeeeeee!<br /><br />

        As you can see I used the same class to make 3 different animals.
    </p>

        <b>Javascript Constructor Functions:</b><br />

        This is seemingly the equivalent to a class in Javascript. A constructor function lets you create an Object via the <em>new</em> keyword. Then you can assign it a bunch of properties.<br /><br />

        var Animal = function Animal(name, type, sound){<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  this.name = name<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  this.type = type<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  this.sound = sound<br />
        }<br /><br />

        var my_cat = new Animal ("Princess Monster-Truck","Cat","Meeeeeow!");<br />
        var my_dog = new Animal ("Marnie","Dog","Woooof!");<br />
        var my_dolphin = new Animal ("Flipper","Dolphin","Eeeeeeeee!");<br /><br />

        console.log(my_cat.name, my_cat.type, my_cat.sound);<br />
        console.log(my_dog.name, my_dog.type, my_dog.sound); <br />
        console.log(my_dolphin.name, my_dolphin.type, my_dolphin.sound);<br /><br />

        I haven’t figured out if there is String interpolation in JS yet, but just stay with me! This outputs:<br /><br /> 
        Princess Monster-Truck Cat Meeeeeow!<br />
        Marnie Dog Woooof!<br />
        Flipper Dolphin Eeeeeeeee!<br /><br />

        You may notice the ‘this’ keyword, which is similar to the self object in Ruby. Calling the property on the object is very similar as you also use the dot operator. The important thing to know here is that object constructors are just regular functions in JS. There seems to be a lot of debate around the use of  constructor functions, but I will save that for another discussion.
