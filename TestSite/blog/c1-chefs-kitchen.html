          <h1>DevBootCamp: The prologue</h1>
          <h4>December 13th, 2014</h4>
          <h2>What am I getting into?!</h2>
         <div class="dotted_break"></div>
          <p>
            I've spent a lot of time wondering about what I want to do with my life and I'm pretty sure I will be asking that question forever, however, this is how I think it supposed to be. For some time I've been unhappy just going to work - particularly at a job I'm not emotionally attached to, and then just collecting my paycheck with no direction. Going back to school didn't seem economically sound in my field of psychology and it really wasn't anything I was very interested anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my entire life I've dabbled in technology. Even when I was in middle school I had played around with making websites from very basic html and I've always been drawn to computers. More recently I found my love for building circuits in audio applications, more specifically tube/valve amplification and guitar/bass effects. Then it clicked. I need to do something creative and for myself to finally be happy. I had been discouraged trying to learn programming myself, but I eventually took some intro classes and stuck with it. I can say, I am the happiest I've been in a long time. My question went from "What do I do with my life?" to "How can I make myself this happy programming and learning all the time?"
          </p>
          <p>
            After doing a lot of research, and actually knowing some personal success stories about "bootcamps", I've arrived at DevBootCamp in NYC. There are some key points about DBC that really resonate with me.
            <ul>
              <li> Intense Focus on Programming (web development)
              <li> Changing Lifestlye through improving not only coding, but oneself
              <li> Taking control of your own education
              <li> An environment with passionate and motivated people just like myself
              <li> The opportunity to learn about employment
            </ul>
        </p>
          <p>
            When people look at DBC, they might think you go through with it just to get a job. While this is my goal to make a living, it's not WHY i'm doing it. I want to be engaged in the culture of development, creativity, and technology. I NEED to be in a state of perpetual learning to be happy. These are skills that can be transferred to many things besides programming. Just being in Phase-0 for a week has tought me a lot.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm incredibly happy, hopeful, nervous, scared, and probably feeling other emotions I don't know how to describe yet, but I KNOW this is the right thing. It's going to be hard, it's going to be emotional, and I'll probably want to punch myself in the face more often than not, but I have a feeling it will change something. <i> The more you put in, the more you get out. </i>
