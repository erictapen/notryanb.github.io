          If you've been following any sort of tech news recently, you may have seen Uber's name pop up. They have been criticized by many for competing unfairly with local taxi companies and driving certain companies out of the market. I won't defend their business practice - as there are lot of questionable things going on, but I wanted to explore the idea of retiring old industries. 
          </p>

          <p>
          Many people feel pushed out of their industry or area of expertise because technology implemented by a few people can increase productivity and produce higher quality work than they can. This goes beyond robots making cars, as it is now effecting every day facets of our lives. Large retailers and shipping companies now delegate many of their menial and repetitive tasks to computers, which can track shipments, do inventory, calculate profits, and probably do many things I'm not even aware of at this point. 
          </p>

          <p>
          Should we embrace the change or fight it? Many cities and countries have filed cease and desist orders against Uber, but is it really fair? Maybe in some instances where they are pushing the boundaries of safety and ethics, but how are we supposed to make progress without celebrating and embracing new ideas? Suppose you make a new app that solves many people's problems (maybe it's life saving?!), but puts a specialized group of people out of work? There's really no way of implementing change without hurting somebody. Hopefully new technology creates new jobs for people, but that means they need a new degree or specialization. That is not necessarily a bad thing, because most people who are living a positive lifestyle are implementing that idea anyway. 
          </p>

          <p>
          There is also the aspect of what society wants. What if our society doesn't want to embrace new technology? Don't they have that right? I suppose its not always such a bad thing to evaluate how change will affect society as a whole. For all we know we could be trying to implement automated death robot into our daily lives! We'd all be living shorter much more paranoid lives, and I'm sure we don't want that. We are in the beginning of a technological revolution. Many new regulations need to be appropriately mandated and conceived by people who actually understand what is going on. If we just take some time to reflect on the industrial revolution we can see that many new laws and mandates came later to improve the lives and safety of workers, while at the same time embracing new technology. I have a feeling the same is in store for us as well.
