          <h1>Week 5 - Feedback</h1>
          <h4>January 25th, 2015</h4>
          <h2>Feedback on feedback.</h2>

          It's week 5 of Phase-0 in my DBC adventure. We're already neck deep in Ruby and learning to implement pair programming. This is the first time I've been exposed to pair programming and the feedback that comes with it. Learning to give and receive feedback is a very important skill to aquire early on. Feedback helps you grow by bringing your skill deficits into focus.

          Pairing with others has been much more pleasant than I originally thought it would. I was initially very nervous because I was comparing myself to other people, which put me more into a fixed mindset. I then realized after reflecting on my sessions about how much I learned when I paired with a more experienced person. I also was able to share the joy of solving the problem with someone; this is something I've never felt before and I finally felt like I fit in somewhere. More recently I had worked with my pair on refactoring our Cipher challenge coursework. We had tested an algorithm in a separate file and then modified it to fit into the code in our project. When it passed all the driver test code we both celebrated with a "**** Yeah!!!!". It was a nice experience to share with someone and it made it all that much better to know other people feel the same way about programming.

          After all of our sessions we have to not only rate other cohort's feedback, but write our own about the pairing sessions. Feedback must be anonymous, specific, actionable, and kind. The most difficult part of writing feedback was making it actionable; particularly with someone more experienced who was kind and patient. I was able to tell them what a good job they did and how much they helped me, but I often had trouble pointing out something to work on. It was definitely much easier when the roles were reversed. Luckily I have had all excellent pairing sessions and came out of them as a better programmer. A few of my pairs had communicated with me after our challenge to pursue some topics of interest or answer questions at a deeper level. This is where pair programming shines in it's educational glory. Working well with someone beneifts all parties involved.

          The most important personal thing about feedback is taking it and modifiying your behavior or actions. I have received some feedback about time management, which I can say is my biggest problem. I like to plow through problems and often become obsessed with solving them without taking breaks. Working with other people has made me realize it's a good thing to take a break and come back later. Almost all of our revelations have come after taking breaks and checking ourselves. My most recent sessions I've taken that feedback and it has helped out a lot. It also created much stronger communication and I was able to be more empathetic to my partner's feeling and drive. My overall feedback about feedback is that it works!
