          I think we tend to spend a great deal of our lives searching for our "purpose" and what we are supposed to do. This does not necessarily mean we are striving for happiness, heck, that may not even have anything to do with our personal strengths or goals. I've been complacent, but mostly unsatisfied for a long time and I finally figured out what to start doing; find happiness! This doesn't mean it's easy or I need to depend on another person or live the American dream. This means I need to figure out what actually makes me happy and how to continue doing it. I found creating things made me happy. I'm already a musician, so I should have known this from the get-go, but I knew I didn't want to be in the music business. Long story short, I found I love programming and building circuits; basically being a hacker. It's been a dream of mine since I was a kid, but I always thought of it like being an astronaut. It's a really cool thing to do, but is it even reasonable to expect that from myself? The answer is heck yeah. Maybe it was my past failures venturing into programming. Being somewhat inclined to music and not so inclined to programming caused me to become really frustrated and resulted in my quitting it several times. This is where the whole point of personal values comes into place.

          In order to succeed at being happy, proud, or have a sense of satisfaction, one must place importance on certain traits or values to help them get there. There are tons, but I want to review a few I've thought about.

          Challenges - I try to challenge myself as much as possible now. Take a seemingly insurmountable problem and break it down until it's a size you can bite off and chew. I wanted to know the big picture immediately when it came to being a programmer. I should've known it takes years of experience and craft to hone your skills. I value taking on new challenges to learn and synthesize new ideas from them. Taking on challenges helps you accept failure without self deprecating and also celebrate success.

          I value Creativity a great deal. Going by the books is good in many ways, and it's a great foundation to help you achieve your goals. This won't solve all your problems, though. Being creative and thinking out of the box, even if it seems crazy at the time has probably lead all the great minds that ever existed to places they would have not otherwise ever been to. I mean this in both a physical and emotional sense. Sometimes your need to approach your goals many times from as many different aspects as possible. Some of them will turn out great, but most will suck. This is okay, because every time you come up with something you are evaluating, reflecting, and increasing the probability of bringing something amazing into existence.

          <p>
          I also want to mention self respect. Part of the reason I felt so defeated in the past was probably because I didn't respect myself. I would say things like "I'll never be a programmer, I should just give up", "I'm so stupid", or "I'm doomed to a life of mediocrity and disatisfaction. Well, if another person was telling those things to me you would probably say they are abusive and cold hearted. So why the heck do we say those things to ourselves? We shouldn't be bullies. Respecting yourself is probably one of the most important qualities to help you achieve your goals. When I start feeling negative and having those thoughts, I try to get in the habit of verbally - out loud - telling myself the complete opposite and reason with myself. You'd be surprised how much better you feel after a few minutes. Fake it 'til yah make it! I don't think we realize that sticking at it and fighting through our problems eventually gets us closer to what we want. It's unreasonable to expect perfection. Part of self respect is admitting you will absolutely fail at times, but that doesn't define you as a person.

          I have friends who are just getting their feet wet in programming (as am I), and they often ask advice from me because I'm a little further ahead. I almost always talk about my own story and how each of us has potential that is untapped. Having good values is half of the battle to happiness.
