          <h1>Week 2 - HTML/CSS</h1>
          <h4>January 02nd, 2015</h4>
          <h2>It's all <em>relative</em>, or is it?</h2>
          <div class="dotted_break"></div>

            <p>
              I've found the most confusing aspect of web design to be positioning. Positioning doesn't work right unless you understand the properties of each html element and how to give them proper attributes in CSS. I'll walk you through the three display properties and how they function with eachother. I've created 3 divs of the same size will alter their properties to demonstrate the effects.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img alt"default position" src="../images/default.png"/>
              <strong>Default Positioning</strong>:<br />
              Here you can see that each div just sits on top of each other. Divs are block-level elements, which means that each time you have one in your html, the next element will start on a new line. You can force block-level elements to display in a horizontal row by adding "display: inline-block" to your css container. For the purpose of this example, lets just say this is the default settings without any position attributes.
            </p>

            <p>
              <img alt"absolute position" src="../images/absolute.png"/>
              <strong>Absolute Positioning</strong>:<br />
              Absolute positioning takes the element out of normal flow. Here you can see that both the relative-named and fixed-named boxes have shifted up and actually over the absolute box. This is because those two no longer recognize the absolute div as being in the normal flow of things. Absolute positioned elements do no effect surrounding elements. An interesting note is that absolute elements will be positioned in relation to their parent element. 
            </p>

            <p>
              <img alt"relative position" src="../images/all_together.png"/>
              <strong>Relative Positioning</strong>:<br />
              Relative elements move an element in relation (or relative!) to where it would have been place normally. In the previous picture, the relative was ignored the absolute div and went right over it. In this example it's still ignoring it, but I've forced the relative to be 50px from the top of the page. It now overlaps with the fixed div (which I've positioned as fixed). If I had made the absolute div set to default with no positioning, the relative div would then be 50px below it, because normal flow dictates that it's relative to the original position it had. Confused yet?
            </p>

            <p>
              <img alt"fixed position" src="../images/fixed-relative.png"/>
              <strong>Fixed Positioning</strong>:<br />
              Fixed positioning is similar to absolute positioning, but it positions the elemement in relation to the browser window. Just like absolute, fixed positioning does not effect surrounding elements, but they also do not move when the user scrolls up or down the window. In this picture you can see I've removed the positional elements from absolute and relative. They are now stacked directly on top of each other as in normal flow and fixed is positioned 75 pixels from the top of the page. 
            </p>

            <p>
              For the most part positions will be set to default when designing webpages, but occasionally you may want an element fixed such as a nav bar that will display regardless of the user scrolling up or down the page. I have not found a use for absolute or relative positioning yet, but as my designs get more complicated at least I have these tools to work with.
