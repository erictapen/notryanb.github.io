          <h2>Hashes vs. Arrays!</h2>
          <div class="dotted_break"></div>
        <p>
          One of the most important things that programmers need to do is store information. You might want to store a bunch of numbers, names, addresses, book titles, or any type of data like that. Then after information is stored, the programmer can get that stuff back anytime they need it. Much like variables, <strong>Arrays & Hashes</strong> can store this information, albeit in different ways. They look quite similar, so lets talks about them one at a time and compare them.
        </p>
        <p>
           <i>Array</i> - An array can also be called a <em>list</em> It stores a list of information in a certain order. That order can change if you sort it, by when items are added, or even if you decided to add or remove items in the middle of it. An array in ruby will look like this:
        </p>   

        <pre class ="prettyprint lang-ruby">
        bands_to_check_out = ["Fugazi", "Lungfish", "Hoover", "June of '44"]
        </pre>

        <p>
         In this case, the array is called "bands_to_check_out" and inside it contains a list of bands that are of the data-type string. The datatypes don't even have to match, because they take up their own space. If a programmer wanted to pull just one of the band names for whatever reason, they have to select it by it's index number. Here's the tricky part. If I wanted to access "Lungfish", which number in the array is it?
       </p>
           
      <pre class ="prettyprint lang-ruby">
      bands_to_check_out[1]
      </pre>

      <p>
         That's right folks, the second item is index 1! The reason for that is because counting starts from 0. There are 4 bands in that array, but they are indexed 0-3.
      </p>

      <pre class ="prettyprint lang-ruby">
        bands_to_check_out[0] = "Fugazi"
        bands_to_check_out[3] = "Hoover"
      </pre>

      <p>
        It's important to understand indexing, because when you want to pull multiple pieces of data, organize, insert, delete, or just about anything else you might want to do, you definitely want to put or remove data from the correct spot.  You can even puts arrays inside of arrays! 
      </p>

      <pre class ="prettyprint lang-ruby">
        freak_out = [[1,2,3]["apple","orange","cheese"]["The Toxic Avenger", 4232.567]]
        
        freakout[1][2] = "cheese"
        freakout[0][0] = 1
      </pre>
      
      <p>
        You may then access each inner array by adding brackets. You can make even deeper arrays, but then the datastructure becomes ever-increasingly complex. After seeing how versatile arrays are for storing data, why would you ever need anything else? Well, we do and it's called the <em>Hashmap</em>
       </p>

      <p>
         <i>Hashes</i> - also called "Hashmaps" are data containers as well, however, the information is stored as a key:value pair. That means that you can store some information and associate it with another name or value. Unlike arrays, hashes don't necessarily store all their data in the order in which they were put in. Perhaps this may be more apparent in an example.
      <p/>

      <pre class ="prettyprint lang-ruby">
        this_is_a_hash = { "my_name" => "Ryan", "age" => 29, 123 = "what?" }
      </pre>
    

      <p>
         In this case, the first variable in each pair is the key and the second is the value associated. If we were to say this_is_a_hash[123], it would output "what?". this_is_a_hash[my_name] would output "Ryan". You can still use some enumerator methods to cycle through a hash (.each).
