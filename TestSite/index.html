        <h2>About me.</h2>
        <div class="dotted_break"></div>

        <p>02.13.2015<br />I recently worked on a pairing challenge to create a cheat sheet for a topic we may need help on. We chose Javascript Prototypes! <a href="cheat-sheet.html">here!</a></p>
        
        <p>01.09.2015<br />I've recently had a GPS session and collaboratively worked on a webpage about pair programming. You can find it <a href="gps1-2/gps1-2.html">here!</a></p>

        <p>12.29.2014<br />I'm Ryan Blecher and I'm a 29 year old developer in training. I'm currently enrolled at DevBootCamp in NYC and I'm going through phase-0. Right now I'm working on my html/css skills, so bear with me as i try to make my site look pretty on the inside and out!</p>

        <p>A few years ago I started fixing guitar and bass amplifiers for friends and fell in love with "being close to the metal". I eventually became very serious about educating myself and started my own business. This coincidentally rekindled my love affair with code. I had dabbled in coding html/c++ for years, but never got anywhere, mostly due to my lack of direction. Then this year I took a class in Python programming which just screamed at me that I <em>needed</em> to code.</p>

        <p>Now I'm currently pursuing my technolust professionally and I'm more excited than ever to meet and study with a myriad of like-minded nerd-folk. Being able to create something even as simple and bare-bones as this gitHub profile site has given me immense joy! Please feel free to look around and contact me with any questions or comments.</p>
