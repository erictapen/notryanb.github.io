A few weeks ago I got word I was being added to the [Increasing Rust's Reach]() project helping make Rust [web-ready]().
Now this may not seem too exciting to an outsider or an experienced rustacean, but for me it was.
I wanted to learn Rust with other *really smart* people and make meaningful open source contributions.
My background is in web development and making rails/hanami/node-ish apps,
so being in a familiar domain certainly helped me focus on getting rust to do the things I was used to.

The past 3 weeks I've been working with the [Diesel]() team on improving documentation and making small commits in the codebase.
What I really want to talk about is how I got started working on my first contribution.

The first thing I did was read through Diesel's [github issues]().
Luckily the maintainers were nice enough to tag a bunch of issues as "easy-for-newcomers".
I read through all of them and decided working on documentation would be the best way for
me to get acquainted with the codebase and learn some core concepts.

Even though I was only working on documentation I decided to get the test suite up and running.
Reading through tests is a great way to become acclimated with the code.
I initially had a lot of issues as the contributing docs weren't up to date,
but this was a great reason to start communicating with the maintainers.

Working on an issue can consume a lot of time and effort,
so it's a good idea to communicate in the issue that you would like to be assigned.
From there you can discuss any problems you're having and get feedback

TLDR;

- Look through issues
- Communicate with the maintainers about your intentions
- Read through any project CONTRIBUTING guidelines
- Run the test suite ;)
- Adapt your contribution to the project style (code or documentation)
- Keep a clean and organized commit history
- Keep an open mind and take feedback seriously
