    <h1>Week 3 - Cultural Blog</h1>
  <h2>Thinking about my thinking style...</h2>
  <h4>January 11th, 2015</h4>
    <p>
      I've made it through unit 1 of Phase 0. There were some ups and downs, but everything is finally starting to sink in. Before we even started, we had an assignment to assess our thinking styles to see how we best learn. I took the Gregorc quiz to see which style my learning and thinking best fit into. Turns out I scored highest on Concrete Random with Abstract Sequential in a close second.

      How could I possibly be two styles of thinking, seemingly opposite? I mean, one is <em>concrete</em> and one is <em>random</em>. After looking through the results and his webpage, I came to the conclusion its completely possible. Abstract Sequential thinkers do not like having too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly, repeating the same the tasks, and lots of specific rules and regulations. They are good at working alone and when they have access to experts and references. Concrete Random thinkers have a difficult time with restrictions and limitations, having no options, re-doing anything once it's done, and keeping detailed records. They are best when able to use trial and error, and able to work through problems by themselves.

      My most difficult time through this phase was time restrictions. While still in work, I had a hard time trying to meet all the specific deadlines, especially while trying to save certain challenges for pairing sessions. I wouldn't say the pairing sessions were all that difficult, but it certainly interrupts my flow of learning. I liked being able to designate time early on for learning and attempting challenges. Due to my work week, it was difficult saving some stuff for Friday / Saturday because I work on Sunday. Here I am writing this blog on Sunday night a few hours before all my work is due. I guess it's not all that bad, but I much rather would have completed work earlier on when possible. As a result, I think some of my work this week felt rushed and was not up to par with the best I could have done. When pressured I also feel its a much greater struggle to learn. Luckily I will be leaving my job next week, so there's only one more week where I really need to struggle with time. I plan on spending a lot more time in our suggested readings and just playing around in code. I've always learned more that way in the past when I was able to digest information without feeling stressed.

      In addition to the learning styles, we also touched upon growth vs fixed mindsets. I am much more cognizant of this idea after learning about it. I now try to apply a growth mindset in every way I possibly can. Every time I fail a challenge or have difficulty learning a topic, I really try to step back and not get frustrated with myself. It's important to tell yourself that you can learn things and take some times to relax. I was certainly more of a fixed mindset person not too long ago where my failures seemed to dictate how I perceived the world. Having a fixed mindset really only limits what you can achieve and everytime you have a setback it's a huge blow to your ego and progress. Taking my problems in stride and taking the time to evaluate my emotions has really helped regulate my stress and the view of myself. I know I don't have to be an incredible genius to be happy and I know every time I fail does not mean the end of me. I truly believe everyone has the opportunity to grow if they focus and spend as much time as they need. I already feel better just writing this blog post and I'm not worried I'll be able to get all the work done by tonight's deadline!
