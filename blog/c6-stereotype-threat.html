    <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
    <h2>How it holds us back.</h2>
    <h4>January 28th, 2015</h4>
    <p>
     What is stereotype threat? Being in a situation where a negative stereotype of your identities applies to you. Realization about being judged in terms of stereotype can interfere with your functioning in that situation. Stereotype threat is a menacing social phenomenon that can hinder our progress and deter us from our goals. You might be able to get an idea of what Stereotype Threat is just from the name, but its a bit deeper than that. A huge part of our lives is our identities, and often we cling to an identity of ours when its particularly threatened. I know I've felt it and you certainly have if you've ever been in a situation where you felt out of place or think you didn't belong. The problem with Stereotype Threat is that it can affect us by producing more stress and leading us to under-perform at our jobs, in school, in social situations, etc.

      My experience is probably what lead me to DevBootcamp. Through highschool I was always a decent student and rarely studied for any class, but I wasn't an A student. By the time I made it to college and wanted to pursue a career in computer science, I realized I may have been in over my head. Maybe it was my lack of experience in more challenging situations, but I certainly felt out of place with all these other students who seemed to understand all the information instantaneously. Eventually I changed majors due to the pressure and tried some programming on my own over the years. I still failed on my own and I was always hearing from the older generation to go back to school. I picked up books and I worked on problems by myself, but I always had this thought in my head that I wasn't a good math student and I didn't perform well at programming in college, so why bother trying? It wasn't until I heard about successful non-traditionally trained programmers that I felt comfortable trying again. It was good feedback encouragement that made me feel comfortable enough to try harder.

      This seems to be the main combat against Stereotype Threat. People in the minority of any situation will fare better and thrive when they feel like the threat against them has been removed. This goes for people of any race, creed, gender, and any other personal identity. It's important, especially in your work or educational environment to minimize Stereotype Threat. Even small or ambiguous social cues can strengthen Stereotype threat, so it's important to try and make all people feel welcome in a work situation. Having posters or advertisements up that only reflect upon one culture, gender, or race, may make the minority in that situation uncomfortable - even having bathrooms in "segregated" areas, for example men and women's bathrooms on different floors can send unintended negative cues towards someone.

      Once someone has experience frustration or a stressful event, these small cues become more apparent and actually affect people physiologically. People may under-perform at their job or school during these times of stress because of how cascading negativity stereotypes infect them. The logic centers of your brain shut down and your emotional response ramps up. How can someone with this experience possibly perform to the best of their ability? A threat is a threat and being animals of the human type, we still have fight or flight responses.

      A major takeaway from learning about Stereotype threat is I know I need to modify feedback. Often feedback has to be critical, especially if improvements need to be made. Ending your feedback by commending the other party and stating your belief in their ability to do the work goes a long way. The more specific, the better. It's this positivity that supports the other person and lets them know that they have the ability. This isn't a cure for Stereotype threat, but repeated exposure to this positive application over time will make someone more comfortable and negate some of the effects.

      We are (thankfully) living in a more progressive time and opportunities are afforded to more people than ever before, but we should be vigilant to combat the Stereotype Threat phenomenon. Be conscious of your environment and get feedback from your colleagues about their comfort levels. Be genuinely supportive of your team and everyone you interact with (within reason of course!).
