        <h2>Dealing with Conflict</h2>
        <div class="dotted_break"></div>
        <p>
          Experiencing conflict in our day to day lives shares much in common with programming. We have a routine that we follow and expect it to run smoothly, but when something goes wrong, it can be overwhelming and difficult to debug our emotions. Taking some time for introspection and breaking our difficulties into smaller steps can help us solve conflicts and better understand how we respond emotionally.

          Most of my life before DBC, I was a counselor for developmentally disabled adults, which is a challenging career to be in as well. I had to make sure my conflict resolution skills were top notch, because the people I was caring for didn't have the skills to regulate their emotions yet. Much of my job was teaching coping skills to help people physically decompress so then they can rationalize their issues. That wasn't the most challenging part; I also had to train new staff on how to empathize and provide this same service. Due to everyone's individual diagnosis, all of their treatment plans have to be individualized.

          After becoming a veteran, I found myself becoming frustrated with the quality of staff I had to train. I would find myself explaining very simple concepts or tasks to do, only to find the new staff not implementing or downright disagreeing with what I taught them. Initially I would vent to my co-workers who also felt the same way and we blamed it on new staff being lazy or always playing with their phones. After reflecting on this I felt disrespected that any wisdom, skills, and knowledge I imparted upon them for their benefit was not valued. Eventually I began to alter the way I went about feedback for the new staff. Instead of myself giving it, I let the individuals voice their own opinions to the new staff to give them guidance. After all, we were there for THEIR benefit and to provide service to THEM! I stopped trying to be the bringer of bad news, and then changed my role as a guide for when the new staff would get undesireable feedback from their caseload. This helped me become less angry and more focused on growth for myself, my staff, and the people receiving services.
