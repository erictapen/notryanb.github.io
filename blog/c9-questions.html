        <h1>Asking good questions.</h1>
        <h4>February 20th, 2015</h4>
        <h2>How do we ask good questions?</h2>
        <div class="dotted_break"></div>
        <p>
          It's the last week of phase-0 and I feel like I've learned so much, but barely anything at the same time! I believe that is just the nature of being a progrmamer. Each project is a new challenge and you have to figure out the best way to solve a problem or complete a task. Unfortunately, or I should rather say fortunately for those interested in programming, there are many... MANY questions left to be answered. Half the battle of answering these questions is asking them in a productive and meaninful way. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I actually have not asked any particular questions using resources such as stack overflow or any community groups, however I have completed searches using some questions. My experience has been that searching for information and asking questions are two fundamentally different activities. Most of my searches have been along the lines of "How to change CSS using javascript" or "ruby case statement syntax". Sometimes I have come across language documentation for my particular problem, but I'll often come across a related StackOverflow or blog post. Every time I've read a post, the subject has been loosely based on my question, where the user is asking for a specific way to implement an idea in their code. Based on my research for asking good questions, it seems most users that had their questions answered were doing it in a "scripted manner". 
        </p>
        <p>
          Asking questions in a certain way can get you the appropriate help in a timely manner. I think it's obvious that a post topic of "PLZ HALP" is bad for many reasons. For one, another user has no idea what you're trying to get help with as there is no topic. Why would someone want to waste time reading something that they may not even have the expertise to help out with? A good questions may take the form of "How to declare functions in a JavaScript object?". Asking direct questions in your title can help you get the right people to chime in. 
        </p>
        <p>
          When asking a question it's always important to provide context. Too much information can be bad, as sometimes you may be revealing protected information about code, but too little is detrimental as well. Stating "I was expecting <i>flipping</i> to return, but <i>flopping</i> returned instead" helps narrow the scope of your question. This will help another user reproduce your problem so they may debug it. Providing the code that gives you the problem will also help someone reproduce the error. With this in mind, be very detailed if there are any errors you are getting and what steps you have taken to try and remedy your problem. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Last but not least, doing your best to convey proper grammar and formatting. This just makes everything easier to read and other people are more likely to take you seriously. This is certainly more difficult for non-native speakers, but it should be pretty obvious not to use l337-5p33k or slang. Most browsers have built in spell checkers and you can always google for definitions and correct spelling. The time you put in to making your question concise and easy to understand will save you much frustration in the long run.
