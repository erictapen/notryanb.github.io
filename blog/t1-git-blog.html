  <h1>Week 1 - Git</h1>
  <h2>... just what the heck is it?!</h2>
  <h4>December 13th, 2014</h4>

    <p>
      I'm finally here! DBC has introduced me to the lifestyle of a web-dev and I'm really excited about it. The hardest part seems like getting started with understanding the toolset and managing your projects. I'd like to review  some information about Git, GitHub, and what they are actually used for.
    </p>

       <i>Version Control</i> - This encompasses everything we're working on in week one. It's a simple concept that you can dissect into the most minute of details. That being said - things can get complicated pretty quickly. Version Control has it's major advantages for teams collaborating on a project. This doesn't necessarily have to be a coding project, it could be a book, mutlimedia project, or anything else you might collaborate on. VC lets each collaborator work on separate parts of a project without interfereing with eachother. Let's say for example that there is a group of people working on a book. Each person may be working on individual chapters, but when they save their work, each segment isn't writing over or erasing the other person's work. If 12 people finish their chapters, they can evaluate them and then MERGE them together to complete the book. This certainly saves the time of writing each chapter in succession. Whoops... what if they made a mistake? VC lets each collaborater individually go back and change their work without effecting or having to rewrite the entire damned (or awesome!) project.

        F<i>git</i>- For developers and programmers, GIT is such a system. It's not the only system, but it's what we're using for DBC. It was developed by Linus Torvalds of Linux fame to help work on the linux kernel. Git lets you create a master version of your project called a <i>repository</i>. Usually there is a small group or one person controlling this master BRANCH of the project. Each other person working on the project (whom may not have control of the project) can make their own copies to freely work on without messing up the original project. This is called FORKING and is a benefit of the GITHUB service, which I will get to soon. From there you may work on the project through various other detailed steps. When you feel your work is adequate, it may be PUSHED to the MASTER if you have permissions to do so, otherwise you need to submit a PULL request to the moderators of the final project. In order to <i>COMMIT</i> a change to any repository, yours or master, it must have a commit with a message detailing what work was done. This is one way for a team to decide if they want to <i>MERGE</i> work together to complete the project. Whoops, someone introduced a bug and destroyed the project!!! That's okay, because git is based on version control, you may go back to earlier versions of the project because they were all commited and documented with what you did. Wow, hindsight = "20/20";
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>GitHub</i> - You may hear git thrown around a lot in place of gitHub. It seems to be implied that you would be using the SERVICE gitHub. gitHub is an online service that lets all of us humans work remotely on projects. This is HUUUUUGE for open source development, because any single person may FORK their own repository, CLONE it to their computer, PUSH the updates to their own FORK, and them submit a PULL request to the moderator of the project. Mind = "blown"; That's right folks, we can contribute to major projects and strengthen the development community by all of this if we felt like it. Don't get confused that git is only for open source. Many private organizations can use the service as well because it is just a system to help teams or individuals to keep track of their work. Even if your computer blows up (darn those LiIon batteries!), you can fetch all of your work form gitHub righ back to your new computer, which you hopefully have a warranty this time.
