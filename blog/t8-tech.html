          Ruby on Rails, also known as just 'Rails' is a web framework for Ruby that lets you work with databases. It has strong emphasis on using certain conventions so you don't have to make many configurations to your apps, and keeping your code DRY. If you've programmed in Ruby, these are probably already ideas you're familiar with.
        </p>  
        <p>
          Rails lets you interact with relational databases in a very methodical and simplified way. Rails maps to a table in a database and a file which you create in Ruby. Rails also uses something called the Model-View-Controller pattern to organize these relationships. The Model part of MVC is the mapping I just talked about.You can create models in Ruby that interact with a table in a certain way. For example - If you're familiar with Twitter, you know that each USER has a whole bunch of tweets, with dates/times/tags/etc. In your Ruby model you can specify aspects of these tweets(which are stored in a relational database) such as minimum amount of characters, numbers etc. The Controller of MVC responds to the web server request of your application that you designed. The controller lets the web server access the models and so they may be Viewed or compiled to HTML.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Rails is essentially a nice toolbox for web application development. It sets up a default environment for you to get your MVP up and running faster with less people and less errors. Rails' ability to increase productivity without sacrificing quality or performance of web applications is one of the main reasons I'm so excited to start using it.

          I started using <a href="http://railsforzombies.org/" target ="blank">Zombies on Rails</a> as a resource to get myself familiar with it. If you already know Ruby and are familiar with OOD, it is pretty easy to get into.
