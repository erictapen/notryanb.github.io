            <h2>What is pair programming?</h2>
            <p>Pair programming is a technique in which two programmers pair together on one work station. One programmer will be in the driver role while the other programmer will be in the navigator role. 
            They work together frequently switching to reduce errors, collaborate on problem-solving/trouble-shooting, and expressing ideas from code to English.</p>

            <h2>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h2>
            <img alt="Blinders" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_IdCOFTpCe0/UJkwF5YQnxI/AAAAAAAAACc/BDASvye-XVI/s1600/PairProgIntroVert.jpg"/>
            <p> Pair programming is important to DBC because it creates clear communication between team members. People misconstrue that programming is a single body activity whereas it actually 
            requires a collaborative approach. It helps reduce coding errors, increases the quality of code, and encourages programmers to share knowledge with each other.</p>

            <h2>Compare Driver and Navigator</h2>
            <p><h3>Common misconceptions about Driver and Navigator roles.</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>People reverse the roles. </li>
                    <li>Drivers are the ones who are dictating the code.

                    <li>Navigators are the ones who type the code.

                    <li>Driver/Navigator roles are rigid.

                        </ul></li>
                    <li>Both parties have to be the same skill level.

            <h2>Feedback</h2>
            <p>Feedback should try be to A.S.K:
                <ul>
                    <li>Actionable: The feedback you give should be able to be implemented.</li>
                    <li>Specific: Give feedback that targets an area that can be improved or highlights something that was well done during the session.</li>
                    <li>Kindness: Honesty is a main part of kindness. Feedback should be truthful and constructive.</li>
                </ul>
